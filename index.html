                We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. Let all these things just sort of happen. Don't fight it, use what happens. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them.
