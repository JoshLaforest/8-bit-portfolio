          We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and
          get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to
          get you addicted. Let all these things just sort of happen. Don't
          fight it, use what happens. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. If
          we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about
          them and take care of them.
